## UI/UX Decisions

The frontend utilizes React, TypeScript, Vite, `shadcn/ui` (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS), TanStack Query, Wouter, and React Hook Form with Zod for a modern and consistent interface. Design elements include professional color wheel visualization, modern chat interfaces with avatars, bubble messages, typing indicators, and severity badges for medical reports. The UI supports role-based content display, smooth transitions, and hover effects. A mobile-first guide page includes circular icons, hover effects, expandable FAQs, and an admin-exclusive DLP guide.

**AI Prevention Chat Design**: AI assistant avatar displays a blue shield icon, user avatars show initials on a blue-indigo gradient.

**Patient Navigation**: Regular patients (non-aiOnlyAccess) access a prevention-only platform, excluding quiz/cybersecurity content. The homepage features an integrated AI Chat Panel, medical reports section, and prevention-focused banner. SEO metadata emphasizes "AI Prevenzione." AI-only access users are redirected to `/prevention`. The navbar is clean, with a logo and user menu (Premium badge removed from avatar area for cleaner UI). Patient dropdown includes AI Prevenzione, Sicurezza, Webinari, Documenti, and optional Corporate/Passa a Premium. Quiz-related sections and data are completely removed for regular patients.

**Token Limits System (Inverted Model)**:
- Regular Patients (prevention-only): Unlimited AI tokens, no limits enforced, no token UI displayed.
- aiOnlyAccess Users (quiz/cybersecurity): Token limits enforced (120 free, 1000 premium, unlimited premium_plus).
- Implementation: Frontend checks `user.aiOnlyAccess` to conditionally render token UI; backend returns `tokenLimit: -1` for regular patients, and triage skips token validation for them.

**Premium Subscription System**: A `/subscribe` page allows direct purchase of Premium (â‚¬29/month) via Stripe checkout, updating `user.isPremium` upon success. Premium benefits include 1000 monthly AI tokens, unlimited AI conversations, medical document upload, personalized reports, 2 weekly televisits, exclusive webinars, full platform access, and 24/7 medical contact.

**Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA/2FA)**: Available to all users via `/security` page with backend endpoints for enabling, verifying, and disabling MFA.

**Prevention Index UI**: A visual placeholder on `/prevention` displays a circular score (static 85/100) when no alerts are present, with an emerald-themed design.

**Role-Based Homepage Routing**: The home page (`/`) redirects users to their role-specific dashboard: Admin to `/admin`, Doctors to `/doctor/patients`, AI-only access to `/prevention`, and normal Patients to the integrated AI Prevention home page.

## Technical Implementations

### Frontend
Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, `shadcn/ui`, TanStack Query, Wouter, and React Hook Form with Zod, including PWA capabilities.

### Backend
Developed using Express.js, Node.js, and TypeScript, offering a RESTful API. Authentication uses Passport.js (local strategy with bcrypt) and persistent sessions. Drizzle ORM provides type-safe access to PostgreSQL. Security features include rate limiting, Helmet.js, CORS, XSS, and SQL injection prevention.

### Data Storage
PostgreSQL (Neon's serverless driver) managed by Drizzle ORM. The schema supports users, subscriptions, quizzes, progress, reports, courses, content, email templates, prevention documents, and audit logs.
