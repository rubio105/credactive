# System Architecture

## Frontend

-   **Technology Stack**: React with TypeScript, Vite, shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS) for UI.
-   **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state; local component state for UI.
-   **Routing**: Wouter for client-side navigation.
-   **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
-   **Path Aliases**: `@/` for client, `@shared/` for shared types/schemas.

## Backend

-   **Framework**: Express.js with Node.js and TypeScript.
-   **API Design**: RESTful, organized by feature.
-   **Authentication**: Replit Auth (OIDC) via Passport.js; express-session with PostgreSQL store.
-   **Database Access**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries, shared schema between frontend and backend.
-   **Build Process**: `tsx` for development, `esbuild` for production server bundle, `vite` for client bundle.

## Data Storage

-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon's serverless driver).
-   **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with schema-first design (`shared/schema.ts`).
-   **Schema Design**: Tables for Users (auth, Stripe), Categories, Quizzes, Questions (JSONB for options), User progress, Reports (JSONB), Sessions, Live Courses, and Static Content Pages.
-   **Migrations**: Managed by drizzle-kit.
-   **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety via Drizzle and shared schema.

## Authentication & Authorization

-   **Strategy**: Replit Auth handles OIDC.
-   **Session Management**: Persistent sessions via `express-session` with PostgreSQL (1-week TTL, httpOnly, secure cookies).
-   **User Flow**: Unauthenticated users see landing page, authenticated users access home page, `isAuthenticated` middleware protects API routes.
-   **User Data**: OIDC claims upserted to database post-auth.

## Quiz System

-   **Structure**: Hierarchical (Categories > Quizzes > Questions), supports multiple choice with explanations.
-   **Flow**: Shuffled questions, timed quizzes, server-side result generation with detailed reports.
-   **Reports**: Standard quiz reports (score, weak areas, recommendations) and Insight Discovery personality assessments.
-   **Categories**: Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking, Compliance & Governance, Business & Innovation, Assessment & Leadership.
-   **Premium Features**: Most content requires an active Stripe subscription.
-   **AI Question Generation**: Admin panel feature using OpenAI GPT-4o for bulk, context-aware question generation (1-1000 questions, configurable difficulty). Supports background processing and automatic persistence.
-   **Question Images**: Supports optional image uploads (max 5MB) for visual questions, stored in `public/question-images/`.
-   **Live Courses**: Integrated system for purchasing one-time live courses via Stripe, with course details, sessions, and enrollment tracking.
-   **Content Management**: System for static content pages (e.g., Privacy Policy, Terms of Service) with rich text editing, HTML sanitization, and public API access.
-   **Language Selection**: Quiz interface includes always-visible language toggle (IT/EN) allowing users to choose quiz language regardless of profile settings. Useful for international certifications like CISSP, CISM that can be taken in multiple languages.

# External Dependencies

-   **Replit Platform Services**: Replit Auth (OIDC), Replit-specific Vite plugins, environment variables.
-   **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL.
-   **OpenAI**: GPT-4o model for AI-powered question generation.
-   **UI Libraries**: Radix UI, Lucide React, Tailwind CSS.
