# System Architecture

## Frontend

-   **Technology Stack**: React with TypeScript, Vite, shadcn/ui (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS) for UI.
-   **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state; local component state for UI.
-   **Routing**: Wouter for client-side navigation.
-   **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation.
-   **Path Aliases**: `@/` for client, `@shared/` for shared types/schemas.

## Backend

-   **Framework**: Express.js with Node.js and TypeScript.
-   **API Design**: RESTful, organized by feature.
-   **Authentication**: Replit Auth (OIDC) via Passport.js; `express-session` with PostgreSQL store.
-   **Database Access**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe queries, shared schema between frontend and backend.
-   **Build Process**: `tsx` for development, `esbuild` for production server bundle, `vite` for client bundle.

## Data Storage

-   **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon's serverless driver).
-   **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with schema-first design (`shared/schema.ts`).
-   **Schema Design**: Tables for Users (auth, Stripe), Categories, Quizzes, Questions (JSONB for options), User progress, Reports (JSONB), Sessions, Live Courses, and Static Content Pages. Supports category images and audio explanations.
-   **Migrations**: Managed by drizzle-kit.
-   **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety via Drizzle and shared schema.

## Authentication & Authorization

-   **Strategy**: Replit Auth handles OIDC.
-   **Session Management**: Persistent sessions via `express-session` with PostgreSQL (1-week TTL, httpOnly, secure cookies).
-   **User Flow**: Unauthenticated users see landing page, authenticated users access home page, `isAuthenticated` middleware protects API routes.
-   **User Data**: OIDC claims upserted to database post-auth.

## Key Features

-   **Quiz System**: Hierarchical structure (Categories > Quizzes > Questions), multiple choice with explanations. Supports shuffled questions, timed quizzes, server-side result generation with detailed reports, and Insight Discovery personality assessments. Includes categories like Cybersecurity, Ethical Hacking, Compliance & Governance, Business & Innovation, Assessment & Leadership.
-   **Premium Features**: Most content requires an active Stripe subscription.
-   **AI Question Generation**: Admin panel feature using OpenAI GPT-4o for bulk, context-aware question generation (1-1000 questions, configurable difficulty), with background processing and persistence. Supports **document-based generation** via PDF upload (max 600 pages, 50MB) - questions are generated from the document content using extracted text as context.
-   **Document Upload**: Quizzes can have optional PDF documents (max 600 pages) for AI question generation. Backend uses pdf-parse to extract and validate content, storing documents in `/public/quiz-documents/`.
-   **Question Media**: Supports optional image uploads for questions and audio explanations (TTS) for question and extended explanations, generated via OpenAI.
-   **Live Courses**: Integrated system for purchasing one-time live courses via Stripe, including course details, sessions, and enrollment tracking. Supports multi-language courses.
-   **Content Management System (CMS)**: Manages static content pages (e.g., Privacy Policy, Terms of Service) with rich text editing, HTML sanitization, and dynamic placement in site navigation (header/footer).
-   **Internationalization**: Multi-language support for home page, live courses, and a prominent in-quiz language selector (IT/EN/ES) allowing users to switch quiz language independently of profile settings, with dynamic audio language sync.
-   **UI/UX**: Utilizes `shadcn/ui` for a modern, consistent interface. Includes features like featured categories on the home page, improved live course enrollment UX, and consistent navigation within the admin panel.
