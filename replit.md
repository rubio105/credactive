# Overview

CIRY (Care & Intelligence Ready for You) is a B2B healthcare prevention platform that uses AI for medical document analysis, patient-doctor communication, and preventive health monitoring. Its primary goal is to improve patient outcomes through early detection and personalized health management. The platform integrates with external applications via a REST API to provide comprehensive medical history context, data storage, and doctor recommendations. CIRY aims to transition from using Google Gemini AI to proprietary ML models through Active Learning.

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

# System Architecture

## UI/UX Decisions

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, Vite, `shadcn/ui` (Radix UI + Tailwind CSS), TanStack Query, Wouter, and React Hook Form with Zod. The design prioritizes medical professionalism through:
- **Color-Coded Medical Alerts**: Four urgency levels (EMERGENCY, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) using healthcare-appropriate colors.
- **Role-Based Homepage Tabs**: Distinct tabs for Patients ("Prevenzione", "I Tuoi Referti", "Appuntamenti") and Doctors ("I Tuoi Pazienti", "Shortcuts Rapidi").
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts for mobile and desktop views, including abbreviated labels and stacked tabs on smaller screens.
- **WhatsApp Notifications**: User-configurable notifications for critical alerts.
- **Navigation Improvements**: Enhanced user flows with features like back buttons and clear UI labels.
- Additional features include a user guide, AI prevention chat, emergency alerts, premium subscription system, MFA, and role-based routing.

## Technical Implementations

### Frontend
Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, `shadcn/ui`, TanStack Query, Wouter, React Hook Form with Zod, and PWA capabilities.

### Backend
Developed using Express.js, Node.js, and TypeScript, providing a RESTful API. It uses Passport.js for authentication (local strategy with bcrypt) and Drizzle ORM for type-safe PostgreSQL access. Security measures include rate limiting, Helmet.js, CORS, XSS protection, and SQL injection prevention.

### Data Storage
PostgreSQL, managed by Drizzle ORM, stores data for users, subscriptions, medical reports, prevention documents, doctor notes, appointments, triage sessions, alerts, notifications, audit logs, login logs, ML training data, and wearable device monitoring (devices, blood pressure readings, proactive health triggers, notifications).
